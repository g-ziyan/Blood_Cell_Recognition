# Blood Cell Recognition
This repo shows an image classification task on the blood cell samples, which achieves 87% accuracy on test images. The project was developed with @Sukeysun. We built convolutional neural networks with the help of Keras. Here you will see a simple but classical machine learning workflow in Python.
